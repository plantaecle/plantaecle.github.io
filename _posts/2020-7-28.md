The musical that has taken the world by storm is now available on DisneyPlus. Maybe you, like me, decided to bite the bullet and bought yourself a month-long subscription to watch the musical and catch up on old nostalgic movies from your childhood. I mean, why not; you’re mostly staying at home, anyway. For those of you who only know Hamilton as a city in south western Ontario, just inspect the ten-dollar American bill; it graces the face of one of America’s founding fathers Alexander Hamilton. 
Ron Chernow’s biography, aptly named Alexander Hamilton, inspired Lin-Manuel Miranda to turn the biography into a musical. The two-and half-hour production features a diverse cast of different creeds and colour, catchy showtunes and less than traditional hip-hop music and eloquent yet genius lyrics that tell a story of one of America’s lesser known founding fathers. From his impoverished roots in the island of Nevis, Hamilton trains himself to become a lawyer before participating in America’s war of freedom. He climbs the ranks from being George Washington’s aide before the war, to ultimately serve as the first Secretary of the Treasury. In the wake of his pre-mature demise, Hamilton had earned many accolades, including writing the Federalist Papers.
The musical has piqued people’s interest in history, presented through the exceptional craft of story telling. Shira Lurie from the Department of History and Canadian studies program here at the university now even offers an American history course from the perspective of the musical [1]. So far, conversation has been mostly about the historical accuracies (and inaccuracies) of the musical, the widespread gun violence and the emergence of underrepresented minority groups in the arts. But outside its pedagogical and historical relevance, I can’t help but wonder why a single musical has become so fascinating and so….addictive!? 
I did some digging around and it turns out some more professional people might already have answers. Musicologist Thomas Peach shares his theory on the addictiveness of Hamilton with Popular Science’s Nicole Dieker; “Addictiveness relies on being compelled to repeat something which creates a response……we are repeating music not only for its musical value, but to re-live physical and emotional responses which accompany it.” [2] Grammy award-winning recoding engineer Tim Latham, with decades of experience backing him, knows the importance of having a wide dynamic range and tempo with subtle variations [2]. There is also something to be said about sound quality and recording. In another interview with Jason Lederman of Popular Science, sound designers Nevin Steinberg and Jason Crystal breakdown what goes on behind the scenes to create the beautifully woven pieces that pull on our heart strings [3]. Meyer Sound’s Source Independent measurement (SIM) serves as a tool to assess “how sound signals move through and interact with the venue” [3]. The placement of two speakers at the venue can be very telling of how sound is absorbed by the room. Next, the DiGiCo SD7-T digital mixing console churns the sounds from the stage. However, limited by digital signal processing (DSP) power, all sounds cannot be mixed. Attaining optimal acoustic resolution ensures a crisp sound reaches the audience. As Steinberg puts it, “Over-speculating and fiddling too much with the acoustic resolution can hurt the sound of a production more than it helps.”
But it doesn’t end there! Even neuroscientists have pondered about these ear worms [4]. A fine balance of originality and familiarity gives us the dopamine release we need to feel happy [4, 5]. Our brains crave novelty. This might explain why simplistic popular music with repetitive structures might wear us out easily and lose its appeal, explains psychologist Philip Russel at the University of Aberdeen [4]. The musical also exploits notions in positive psychology. The major and recurring members of the cast display positive qualities ranging from bravery, kindness and comradery. When in dire straits, they even show remorse or forgiveness. These benevolent archetypes motivate us to be our best selves through “cinematic elevation”. The powerful ballads they sing sway us to their cause of overcoming hurdles of injustice and we too, from our seats, aspire for freedom and to be part of a cause bigger than ourselves [6].
With its many layers and intricacies, Latham gives some solid advice: “It is a very dense record …..and it does require multiple listenings to absorb the whole thing.” [2] I believe this to be true for any good piece of music, from Bach to Daft Punk. Theatre geek or not, if I have intrigued you even in the slightest, I strongly encourage you to watch Hamilton: An American Musical
